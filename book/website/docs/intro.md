# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Systems

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**, where we explore the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and embodied systems.

## About This Book

This book is designed to take you from **digital AI** to **Physical AI** — where AI models are no longer confined to screens but operate in real and simulated physical environments. You'll learn how to build intelligent systems that perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## What You'll Learn

- The fundamentals of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence
- ROS 2 architecture for robotic systems
- Simulation environments like Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems
- Humanoid robotics concepts and implementation
- Building conversational robots that can understand and execute commands

## Who Should Read This

This book is ideal for:
- AI/CS students (Beginner to Intermediate level)
- Developers looking to enter robotics or Physical AI
- Professionals interested in Embodied Intelligence

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts

## Book Structure

The book is organized into seven parts:

1. **Foundations of Physical AI** - Core concepts and principles
2. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Communication and control
3. **Digital Twins & Simulation** - Virtual environments for testing
4. **The AI Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Perception and navigation
5. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Understanding and executing commands
6. **Humanoid Systems** - Locomotion, manipulation, and interaction
7. **Capstone Project** - End-to-end implementation

Let's begin our journey into the world of Physical AI!
