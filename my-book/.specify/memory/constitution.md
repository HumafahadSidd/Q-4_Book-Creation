# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Embodied Intelligence Focus
This book bridges digital AI systems and real-world embodied intelligence through humanoid robotic platforms. All content must connect theoretical AI concepts with practical physical implementation in simulated and real environments.

### II. Educational Accessibility
Content must be structured in a clear, instructional, and beginner-friendly manner. Technical concepts should be explained before tools, with step-by-step concept building that avoids unnecessary mathematical complexity unless required.

### III. Safety and Ethics First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All content must emphasize robotic safety, human-centered design, and ethical deployment of humanoid robots. Content must avoid instructions that may cause physical harm and address latency, reliability, and real-world constraints.

### IV. Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real) Approach
Focus on the transition from simulated environments to real hardware deployment. Content should include both simulated and real-world examples with practical learning outcomes.

### V. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration
All AI systems covered must integrate perception, language, and action pipelines. Content should demonstrate how AI models interact with sensors, actuators, and robotic systems.

### VI. Technical Foundation
All content must be grounded in engineering principles with real technical implementations. No fictional or speculative hype without engineering basis. Content must follow the chapter design rules including conceptual overview, technical components, tools and frameworks, examples, and learning outcomes.

## Target Audience and Educational Objectives

Content is designed for AI and Computer Science students, Robotics and Mechatronics learners, Developers transitioning from software AI to Physical AI, and Educators and advanced beginners in robotics. By the end of the book, readers should be able to understand Physical AI and embodied intelligence, design and simulate humanoid robots, deploy AI models from simulation to real hardware, integrate perception-language-action pipelines, and build a capstone-level autonomous humanoid system.

## Writing Standards and Style Guidelines

All content must follow the specified writing style: clear, structured, and instructional with technical but beginner-friendly explanations. Use diagrams descriptions where relevant and maintain a professional, academic, and future-focused tone. Content must be written as a senior AI & Robotics architect and educator.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices for this book project. All content must strictly follow this constitution, maintain consistency across all chapters, explain concepts before tools, not skip foundational reasoning, and always connect theory with physical execution. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Content must avoid political, irrelevant, or promotional content and must not contain copied or plagiarized material.
